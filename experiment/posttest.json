      "question": "The total number of Hamiltonian circuits in a complete undirected graph of n vertices will be ____ ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "(n-1)!",
        "b": "(n-1)!/2",
        "c": "(n+1)!",
        "d": "(n+1)!/2"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While this counts all possible arrangements of n-1 vertices, it overcounts by including both clockwise and counterclockwise versions of the same circuit.",
        "b": "Correct! In a complete graph, we can start at any vertex and arrange the remaining n-1 vertices in (n-1)! ways. However, since each circuit can be traversed in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise), we divide by 2 to avoid counting each circuit twice.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would count arrangements of n+1 vertices, which is more than the actual number of vertices in the graph.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This uses n+1 vertices instead of n-1, leading to an incorrect count of possible circuits."

      "question": "If G is a simple graph with n-vertices and n>=3, the condition for G has a Hamiltonian circuit is _________",
      "answers": {
        "a": "the degree of each vertex is at most n/2",
        "b": "the degree of each vertex is equal to n",
        "c": "the degree of every vertex is at least n+1/2",
        "d": "the degree of every vertex in G is at least n/2"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Having vertices with degree at most n/2 could result in a graph that's too sparse to guarantee a Hamiltonian circuit.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This condition is too strict - it would require the graph to be complete, which isn't necessary for having a Hamiltonian circuit.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This condition is mathematically impossible as the maximum degree in a simple graph with n vertices is n-1.",
        "d": "Correct! This is Dirac's theorem: if G is a simple graph with n vertices (n≥3) and minimum degree ≥n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian circuit. This ensures enough connectivity to traverse all vertices."

      "question": "The time complexity to find a Eulerian path in a graph of vertex V and edge E is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(V^2)",
        "b": "O(V+E-1)",
        "c": "O(V+E)",
        "d": "O(E+1)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This overestimates the complexity - we don't need to check all pairs of vertices.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While close to the correct answer, subtracting 1 doesn't affect the big-O notation and isn't necessary.",
        "c": "Correct! Finding a Eulerian path requires checking connectivity (O(V+E)) and verifying vertex degrees (O(V)). The total complexity is O(V+E) as we need to visit each vertex and edge exactly once.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This ignores the necessary vertex checks and doesn't properly represent the graph traversal complexity."

      "question": "Consider a connected multigraph with 8 vertices has an Euler circuit. Which of the following degrees is possible for each vertex so that the graph has an Euler circuit?",

        "b": "4",
        "c": "5",
        "d": "7"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. An odd degree (3) cannot be part of an Euler circuit as you wouldn't be able to exit the vertex after entering it an odd number of times.",
        "b": "Correct! For an Euler circuit to exist, all vertices must have even degree. Among the given options, 4 is the only even number, making it the only possible degree for each vertex.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Like option 'a', an odd degree (5) would make it impossible to have an Euler circuit.",
        "d": "Incorrect. An odd degree (7) would prevent the formation of an Euler circuit as you can't enter and exit the same number of times."

      "question": "The traveling salesman problem involves n cities with paths connecting the cities. The time taken for traversing through all the cities, without knowing in advance the length of a minimum tour, is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(n)",
        "b": "O(n^2)",
        "c": "O(n!)",
        "d": "O(2^n)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Linear time is impossible for TSP as we need to consider all possible permutations of cities.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Quadratic time would be too efficient for this NP-hard problem - it needs to check all possible tours.",
        "c": "Correct! The brute force approach requires checking all possible permutations of n cities, leading to n! possible tours. Each tour needs to be evaluated to find the minimum cost path.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While exponential, 2^n is actually less than n! for large n, making it too optimistic for the TSP without additional information."

      "question": "In a weighted graph G, what is the time complexity of finding both an Euler circuit and a minimum spanning tree?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(V + E log E)",
        "b": "O(V^2 + E)",
        "c": "O(E log V)",
        "d": "O(V^2 log V)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Finding an Euler circuit takes O(V + E) time, and finding a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm takes O(E log E) time. The total complexity is dominated by the MST computation, giving O(V + E log E).",
        "b": "Incorrect. This overestimates the complexity of finding an Euler circuit and underestimates the MST computation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While this is the complexity of Prim's algorithm with a binary heap, it doesn't account for finding the Euler circuit.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is much higher than necessary and doesn't accurately represent either operation's complexity."

      "question": "What is the maximum number of edges possible in a planar graph with n vertices (n ≥ 3) that has no triangular faces?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "3n - 6",
        "b": "2n - 4",
        "c": "2n - 2",
        "d": "3n - 3"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is the maximum number of edges for any planar graph, but the constraint of no triangular faces reduces this number.",
        "b": "Correct! For a planar graph with no triangular faces, each face must have at least 4 edges. Using Euler's formula and the fact that each edge belongs to two faces, we can prove that the maximum number of edges is 2n - 4.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This exceeds the actual maximum possible edges for a planar graph with no triangular faces.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This would allow too many edges for a planar graph with the given constraint."

      "question": "In a tournament graph with n vertices, what is the minimum number of edges that must be reversed to make the graph strongly connected?",

        "a": "⌈log₂n⌉",
        "b": "⌊n/2⌋",
        "c": "n-1",
        "d": "⌈(n-1)/2⌉"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is related to the number of vertices needed for 2-step paths, not edge reversals for strong connectivity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is too many edges - a tournament can be made strongly connected with fewer reversals.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would be the number of edges in a spanning tree, but we need fewer reversals.",
        "d": "Correct! In a tournament graph, reversing ⌈(n-1)/2⌉ edges is both necessary and sufficient to ensure strong connectivity. This can be proved using the properties of tournament graphs and their strongly connected components."

        "a": "Euler circuit",
        "b": "Perfect matching",
        "c": "Hamiltonian cycle",
        "d": "Spanning tree"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The sum of degrees condition relates to vertex connectivity and paths, not to the existence of an Euler circuit which requires even degrees.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While this condition ensures good connectivity, it doesn't guarantee a perfect matching which requires different properties.",
        "c": "Correct! This is Ore's Theorem: if G is a simple graph with n≥3 vertices where deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n for every pair of non-adjacent vertices u and v, then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle. This is a stronger result than Dirac's theorem.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While the graph would contain a spanning tree, this is a much weaker conclusion than what the given condition guarantees."

      "answers": {
        "a": "G contains exactly one cycle",
        "b": "G is bipartite",
        "c": "G has a perfect matching",
        "d": "G has an Euler path"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! In a connected graph, if |E| = |V| = n, then the graph must contain exactly one cycle. This follows from the fact that a tree has n-1 edges, so adding one more edge must create exactly one cycle (unicyclic graph).",
        "b": "Incorrect. The number of edges and vertices doesn't determine whether a graph is bipartite - this depends on the structure of connections.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Having n vertices and n edges doesn't guarantee a perfect matching, as the edges might not be distributed in a way that allows pairing all vertices.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A graph with n vertices and n edges might not have an Euler path as the degrees of vertices aren't guaranteed to satisfy Euler path conditions."

        "b": "6",
        "c": "9",
        "d": "12"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This underestimates the number of possibilities - a 3-regular graph with 8 vertices has more ways to form perfect matchings.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While closer, this doesn't account for all possible combinations in a 3-regular graph of this size.",
        "c": "Correct! In a 3-regular graph with 8 vertices: 1) Each vertex has degree 3, giving 12 edges total. 2) A perfect matching needs 4 edges to cover all 8 vertices. 3) Using Hall's Marriage Theorem and counting principle, we can prove there are exactly 9 different ways to select 4 edges that don't share vertices.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This counts the total number of edges in the graph (8*3/2 = 12) rather than the number of possible perfect matchings."

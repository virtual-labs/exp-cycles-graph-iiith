### Objective

This experiment aims to help students understand and practice key concepts in graph theory through interactive tasks. Students will learn to:
- Identify and construct Hamiltonian cycles in graphs
- Determine whether a graph is Eulerian
- Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using weighted graphs

#### Task 1: Drawing Hamiltonian Cycle

1. Draw a Hamiltonian cycle by following these steps:
   - Click edges to form a closed loop
   - Start and end at the same node
   - Visit each node exactly once

2. Submit your solution:
   - If a Hamiltonian cycle exists: Select edges in the correct order, then click submit
   - If no Hamiltonian cycle exists: Click submit without selecting any edges

3. Review your answer:
   - Check the answer in the observation window
   - Read the provided explanation

4. Try another graph:
   - Click the "change graph" button to get a new graph


#### Task 2: Validating Eulerian Graphs

1. Analyze the given graph:
   - Use the buttons in the Observation window
   - Determine if the graph is Eulerian

2. Verify your answer:
   - Check your response in the observation window

3. Practice with different graphs:
   - Click the "change graph" button to get a new graph


#### Task 3: Finding Shortest Weighted Routes

1. Analyze the weighted graph:
   - Find the shortest route that:
     - Visits all nodes exactly once
     - Returns to the starting node

2. Draw your solution:
   - Select edges in order to show the shortest weighted path

3. Check your work:
   - Verify your answer in the observation window

4. Try more examples:

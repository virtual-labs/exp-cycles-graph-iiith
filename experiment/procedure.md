### Procedure

#### Task 1 

- To draw Hamiltonian cycle click edges to form a closed loop, by finishing at the starting node and visiting each node exactly once.
- If hamiltonian cycle exists, select the edges in correct order to draw hamiltonian cycle, then click submit .
- If there is no hamiltonian cycle, click submit without selecting any edge.
- Check the answer and explanation in the observation window.
- Click change graph button to get new graph.


#### Task 2 

- Validate If the graph is Eulerian or not using the buttons in Observation window.
- Check the answer in the observation window 
- Click change graph button to get new graph.


#### Task 3

- Find the shortest weighted route to visit all the nodes once and returns to the origin node.
- Select the edges in order to draw the Shortest weighted path.
- Check the answer in the observation window 
- Click change graph button to get new graph.
